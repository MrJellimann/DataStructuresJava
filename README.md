# DataStructuresJava
Written By: Christopher Walen

A large project containing working examples of every data structure that I know, programmed in Java.

The purpose of this project is mainly for portfolio and referential reasons. Which I will describe below:
  Portfolio:
    To demonstrate my proficiency in the data structures taught to me over the course of my Computer Science degree, and to demonstrate that I have sufficient knowledge in using and applying the Java language in solving problems.
  Referential:
    To have a working repository of classes that represent data structures in a working capacity, so that if need be I can refer back to this repository to refresh myself on the structure of these data structures in Java.
